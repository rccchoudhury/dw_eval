You are helping filter PRs to identify which ones contain sufficient substance for generating meaningful codebase questions.

# Task

Determine whether this PR is suitable for generating high-quality technical questions that would help developers understand the codebase.

# Criteria for ACCEPT (return true)

A PR should be accepted if it meets MOST of these criteria:
- Contains non-trivial code changes (not just formatting, typos, or config tweaks)
- The PR description provides meaningful context about what changed and why
- The code changes involve actual logic, algorithms, or architectural decisions
- There's enough substance to ask questions about how components work or interact
- A developer would need to understand this code to work on related features

# Criteria for REJECT (return false)

A PR should be rejected if it matches ANY of these:
- Empty or near-empty PR description (just a title, or "see title", or no explanation)
- Trivial changes only: typo fixes, formatting, whitespace, comment updates
- Pure configuration changes with no logic (changing version numbers, build configs)
- Automated dependency updates with no code changes
- Simple find-and-replace refactoring (renaming variables/functions across files)
- Deleting code without adding new logic
- The code context is too minimal to generate substantive questions

# Examples

**ACCEPT examples:**
- PR adds a new authentication flow with error handling
- PR refactors a complex algorithm and changes how it processes data
- PR implements a new API endpoint with validation logic
- PR fixes a bug by changing control flow and adding edge case handling

**REJECT examples:**
- PR: "Update version to 2.0.1" (config only)
- PR: "Fix typo in comment" (trivial)
- PR: "Bump dependency versions" (automated, no logic changes)
- PR description: "Updates" or just the title repeated (no context)
- PR: "Remove unused imports" (cleanup only)
